      <p>The pERK response to FGF-1 (y-axis) is strongest at the first time
      point (10 minutes) and decreases thereafter, while the pAKT response to
      IGF-1 occurs only at the last time point and is much weaker. In general,
      the Her2amp cell lines (triangles) that are the most responsive to
      Lapatinib (in red) are the weakest responders to FGF-1 or IGF-1.

      <p>Move the slider to view the response at the different timepoints (10,
      30 and 90 minutes).

      <h3>Basal pErbB2 vs. ErbB2</h3>

      <p>
      Basal expression levels and phosphorylation levels of ErbB2 are strongly
      correlated. The cell lines responsive to Lapatinib (red) are the ones with
      the highest levels of ErbB2 which are mainly Her2amp (triangles).

      <p>

      Average pERK fold-change response to BTC and EGF are strongly correlated,
      suggesting strong similarities in the response to ErbB ligands targeting
      similar receptors. The Her2amp cell lines (triangle) are the least
      responsive cell lines.

      Average pAKT fold-change response to EFG and HRG are not correlated,
      showing that HRG is significantly different from other ErbB ligands. The
      HR+ cell lines (squares) being responsive only to HRG.

      <p>

      FGFs predominantly signal to pERK, but not to pAKT. Cells are responding
      by pERK (y-axis) to stimulation by FGF-1, but pAKT (x-axis) is hardly
      increased.

      <p>
      
      IGFs signal predominantly to AKT. Simulation with IGF-1 activates more
      pAKT (x-axis) than pERK (y-axis). In general, the Her2amp cell lines
      (triangle) are the least responsive cell lines.
