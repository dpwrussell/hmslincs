<h2>Time course response</h2>
<img src="img/timecourse/{{ name }}.jpg"
     width="700" height="233" />
<p class="caption">Fold-change response of pERK and pAKT following 10, 30 or 90 minutes treatment with {{ name }} at 1ng/ml (left) or 100ng/ml (right). Colored trajectories represent the indicated cell lines and all remaining cell lines are gray. Non-significant responses (below ~1.2-fold) are set to 1.</p>

<h2>Pathway bias</h2>
<img src="img/pathwaybias/{{ name }}.jpg"
     width="700" height="292" />
<p class="caption">(Left) Distribution of the pathway bias across cell lines for {{ name }} (in black) and {% if name == "FGF-1" %}2 reference ligands (IGF-1, yellow; and EGF, red)
   {% else %}{% if name == "EGF" %}2 reference ligands (FGF-1, blue; and IGF-1, yellow)
   {% else %}{% if name == "IGF-1" %}2 reference ligands (FGF-1, blue; and EGF, red)
   {% else %}3 reference ligands (FGF-1, blue; IGF-1, yellow; and EGF, red){% endif %}{% endif %}{% endif %} where the bias is defined as the arctangent of the ratio of the pAKT to pERK fold change responses (maximum across the three time points at 100ng/ml). (Right) Distribution of the pathway bias for all ligands that exhibited a least 50% significant responses across all cell lines when stimulated at 100ng/ml. Ligands are sorted according the median of the pathway bias and colored as in the left panel.</p>

<h2>Dose response</h2>
<img src="img/doseresponse/{{ name }}.jpg"
     width="700" height="233" />
<p class="caption">Fold change pERK (left) and pAKT (right) responses following treatment with {{ name }} at 1ng/ml and 100ng/ml (maximum response across 10, 30 and 90 minutes). Colored trajectories represent the indicated cell lines and all remaining cell lines are gray. Non-significant responses (below ~1.2-fold) are set to 1.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity class</h2>
<img src="img/sensitivity/{{ name }}.jpg"
     width="700" height="292" />
<p class="caption">Distribution of sensitivity classes by ligands for pERK (left) and pAKT (right): ‘Equal’ (red) means that the fold change response at low dose is at least 75% of the high dose response; ‘100ng>1ng’ (blue) means that low dose response is statistically significant but less than 75% of the high dose response; ‘only 100ng’ (yellow) means that only the high dose response is significant.</p>

<h2>Kinetic cluster</h2>
<img src="img/responsekinetics/{{ name }}.jpg"
     width="700" height="245" />
<p class="caption">Distribution of the kinetics of the responses at 100mg/ml for {{ name }} (left) and the different ligand families (ErbB ligands, Ins/IGF ligands, FGF-1/2, and all remaining ligands) for pAKT (top) and pERK (bottom). Kinetics classes are determined by an unsupervised k-means clustering of the time-series data that identified trajectories that correspond to sustained, transient, late, or no response.</p>
