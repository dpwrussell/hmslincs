<p>One component of the HMS LINCS initiative is the creation of a highly curated
library of kinase inhibitors. We are focusing on clinical compounds (FDA
approved or undergoing trials) and tool compounds which are highly selective for
important kinases.

<p>To facilitate access to our library of inhibitors, we created this simplified
network map of key signal transduction pathways that includes the majority of
kinases we can selectively target with small molecules. This allows biologists
to rapidly find compounds which target a given kinase or affect a specific
phenotypic outcome, as well as to identify compounds with potentially similar or
synergistic effects by virtue of targeting different nodes in the same signal
transduction cascade.

and it will give immediate clues about the
potential immediate biochemical effects of treatment with a given inhibitor.

<p>Clicking on proteins shaded in red give information on all inhibitors with
that protein as nominal target. Included is compressed information on the growth
inhibition to a small sample of breast cancer cell lines and whether or not the
protein is targeted for clinical applications. Clicking through to individual
inhibitors links the user back to all information for a given inhibitor
contained in our database.

<p>You may also use our full database search engine to
find <a href="/db/sm/">compounds</a> or <a href="/db/proteins/">protein
targets</a> by name or other attributes.
