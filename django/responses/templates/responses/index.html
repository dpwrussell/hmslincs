      <h3>pERK response to FGF-1 vs. pAKT response to IGF-1 (over time)</h3>

      The pERK response to FGF-1 (y-axis) occurs early, while the pAKT response
      to IGF-1 occurs at the last time point. In general, the Her2amp cell lines
      (triangles) that are the most responsive to Lapatinib (in red) are the
      weakest responders to FGF-1 or IGF-1.

      <h3>Basal pErbB2 vs. ErbB2</h3>

      Basal expression levels and phosphorylation levels of ErbB2 are strongly
      correlated. The cell lines responsive to Lapatinib (red) are the ones with
      the highest levels of ErbB2 which are mainly Her2amp (triangles).

      Average pERK fold-change response to BTC and EGF are strongly correlated,

      similar receptors. The Her2amp cell lines (triangle) are the least
      responsive cell lines.

      FGFs predominantly signal to pERK, but not to pAKT. Cells are responding
